Similar to a traditional black tea, our specially selected, long cut rooibos leaves are fully oxidised for a sweet, honeyed herbal infusion. Naturally caffeine-free, Rooibos has a soft, gently tangy flavour with a distinctive hint of bitter Seville orange richness. Did you know, ‘herbal infusion’ is a preferable term to ‘herbal tea’, as tea is an infusion of leaves only from the Camellia sinensis. Please dispose of your used tea bags in your council food waste bin.",
